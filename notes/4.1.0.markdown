This release contains one nice enhancement and one bug-fix:

* ScalaJack now supports references to the containing class, so you have have structures like this:

case class Person( 	
	name : String, 	
	spouse : Person,  // a reference to the containing class 	
	kids : List[Person] 
	)

Containing-class referencing works for parameterized types too:

case class Person[T](
	name : String,
	spouse : Person[T],
	friend : Person[Boolean]
)

* Fixed/adjusted Joda DateTime handling to always reference UTC+0.  
**NOTE:** This may be a breaking change if you were expecting local time conversion!  Sorry 'bout that, but it will be better having a fixed point of reference for time handling.
