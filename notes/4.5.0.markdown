This is a segnificant release with breaking changes.

This release supports the (relatively) new asynchronous drivers for MognoDB.  This is an upgrade from the older, synchronous Casbah drivers.

The ".0" release may be a little unproven so use with care.  4.4.6 is still using the "trusted" Casbah drivers if needed.

Since the new drivers cleaned up the MongoDB representation to incorporate stronger typing, new handler support was needed for
VisitorContext's custom value class handlers.  Now there's a Map[ mode -> Map[ classname -> ValClassHandler ] ] structure,
where 'mode' is either 'default' (json) or 'mongo'.  This is because the 'Any' type on the handlers actually needs to be
different things for mongo and json.  For json it all resolves to String.  For mongo the Any resolves to BsonValue (meaning
you'll have to typecast the Any to some BsonValue).

If it all sounds complex, well, it is a bit.  See the tests, particularly in the mongo subproject for some help.
For examples of custom value class handlers grep for "valClassHandlers" in the test code.
