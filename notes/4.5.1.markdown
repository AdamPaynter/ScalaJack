This is a major update with breaking changes.

The big news is a move to support the (relatively) new async drivers for MongoDB (deprecating Casbah).
Note this is new, so the ".1" code should be used cautiously.  Version 4.4.6 still uses tried 'n true Casbah.

The new drivers tighten up type safety considerably within MongoDB's driver, which is a good thing, but drives
some change in ScalaJack, particularly necessitating reworking how the custom value class handlers work.

Please see examples in mongo subproject test code.  Grep around for 'valClassHandlers'.
