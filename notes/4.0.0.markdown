This is a complete re-write of ScalaJack.  There are several improvements to this version.

* Greatly cleaned-up/reduced the code!  Uses Scala 2.11 reflection enhancements.
* A little bit faster
* Greatly expanded type support, particularly collections
* Revised/simplified custom JSON for value classes
* Cake-pattern based design for extensions (like for Mongo support)
* Removed (for now) MySQL support
* Can handle more complex parameterized types than ScalaJack 3.x series
* Removed Jackson dependency
* Provides validating and non-validating (faster) JSON tokenizers
