Version 1.6.0 of ScalaJack introduces one significant change and one new feature.

The readList, renderList, readListDB, and renderListDB calls have all be deprecated and removed.
Now you just supply the right type to the normal read/render calls, e.g. ScalaJack.read[List[Foo]].
This change is breaking, so we bumped to a new minor version number, but it does simplify the
API.

Naked Maps are now supported with the proviso that the first type paramter of the Map
is always String, to be compatible with JSON.  For example: ScalaJack.read[Map[String,Int]].
