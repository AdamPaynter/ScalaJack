This is a special release!  ScalaJack now supports paramterized types for case classes
and traits.  So now, not only is ScalaJack a fast parser, it is one of the most powerful too.
Of course this works with the MongoDB rendering too.

ScalaJack isn't a compiler, so there will certainly be combinations of parameterized types
that will confuse it, but the supported configurations are many.  See the test suite for
an exhaustive list.

To our knowledge, this is currently the only Scala JSON parser that supports parameterized
types, so now you can use more sophisticated models.
